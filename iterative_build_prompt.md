We are going to build a project iteratively. I will start with a rough idea, and I need you to help me refine it. Ask me questions—obvious, non-obvious, and technical—until we have a clear understanding of what I am implementing.

Do not plan 1000 steps ahead; keep things simple. We will build as we go, prompt by prompt. We may revisit and refine previous steps.

Crucially, keep track of a high-level summary of the work we have done so we can reference it clearly as we progress.
