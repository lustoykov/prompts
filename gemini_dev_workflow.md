I am providing a rough idea for a project. We will build it together using an iterative, phase-based approach.

### Phase 1: Planning & Specification
Interview me in detail about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. to refine the idea. Make sure the questions are not obvious and push for clarity on edge cases.

Continue interviewing me until the requirements are clear. Once complete, write a comprehensive `SPEC.md` file that will serve as our source of truth.

### Phase 2: Iterative Implementation
After the spec is established, we will build the project iteratively, one prompt at a time.

- **Continuous Inquiry:** During this phase, continue to ask me questions—obvious, non-obvious, and technical—until we have a clear understanding of what I am implementing for the specific step at hand.
- **Living Spec:** We may revisit and refine previous steps. Crucially, if we discover new findings or decide to change the approach, we must update the `SPEC.md` to reflect these changes.
- **Simplicity:** Do not plan 1000 steps ahead; keep things simple. We will build as we go.
- **Context Management:** At the end of each significant implementation step, provide a high-level summary of the work completed so far to keep our context clear as the project grows.
