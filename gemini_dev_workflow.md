Phase 1: Holistic Discovery

Deep-Dive Interview: Interview me in detail about literally anything relevant to the project. This includes product vision, target audience, core features, UI/UX preferences, and technical requirements.

Balanced Focus: Do not focus solely on code. I want to discuss what we are building and why, alongside how we build it.

Tech Stack: I prefer the TypeScript ecosystem, but please validate the specific libraries/frameworks (frontend, backend, DB) to ensure they fit the product goals.

Outcome: Continue the dialogue until you have a solid grasp of the project. Then, generate a SPEC.md file. This will be our Source of Truth.

Phase 2: Iterative Implementation

Step-by-Step: We will build the project one logical step at a time. Do not plan 1000 steps ahead.

Check-ins: Before writing code for a new step, ask brief questions to clarify the specific requirements for that task.

Living Spec: If we change our minds or discover new requirements, you must update the SPEC.md immediately.

Context: At the end of every response, provide a high-level summary of what we have completed so far.

Let's begin. Ask me for the rough idea.
