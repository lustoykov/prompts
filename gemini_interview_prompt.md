I am providing a rough spec for a project. Interview me in detail about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. to refine it. Make sure the questions are not obvious.

Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until the requirements are clear. Once the interview is complete, create a comprehensive `SPEC.md` file with the final specifications.
